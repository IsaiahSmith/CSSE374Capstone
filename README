This tool is ultimately used to take in a software package and give the programmer some useful UML
so that they can see their software's design.

Milestone 1

Our design:
	
	

Who did what?

	Daniel: Mastermind behind our design; came up with most of the ultimate design for our project.
		Participated in pair programming working with the vistors and the class builder. Gained idea
		on how GraphViz and dot files work. Wrote tests.

	Neo: Helped in creating design. Participated in pair programming in setting up the builders and
		some parsing stuff. Set up the StandardDot that goes at the top of each dot file.

	Isaiah: Wrote this README. Helped in creating design. Participated in pair programming in general methods in 
		ClassBuilder and ClassDelcarationVistor. Learned how to use GraphViz and what dot files are 
		and how to make one.
	
	
How to use our code:
		To use our code, run the "main" class as a java application. In the console, type "dot" for the 
	encode type and anything for the output file name. Open the GVEdit program for GraphViz and open
	the file that you just named. Click the running dude button and UML should be generated!

Milestone 2

Evolution of Design:
	From Milestone 1 ->
		
	To now ->
		Our design did not really change much from the original plan. That is because of how we
		designed it in the first place. To add new arrows, all that we had to do was create
		the DotUsesDecorator and the DotAssocciationDecorator classes and figure out the logic
		behind it using our ClassBuilder.


Who did what?

	Daniel: Helped with the methods that dealt with the logic behind making arrows. Wrote tests.
	
	Neo: Set up initial framework for the new classes that the arrows were made in with the help of Isaiah. 
	
	Isaiah: Wrote this README and put in manually generated UML diagrams. Wrote the methods for
		logic behind making arrows.
